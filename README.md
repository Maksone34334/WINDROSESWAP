# Monorail MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows you to get quotes, trade transactions and token information from Monorail's APIs

We originally shared the API information [in this gist](https://gist.github.com/donovansolms/d6d8a869f7a5095bdd0592c390f47d13) for anyone to use, but thought providing a full MCP server would speed things up for anyone that wants to use our APIs via AI.

### Support

We've opened up a channel in our Discord specifically for this challenge and for anyone that wants to use (or experiment) with our APIs. You can join our Discord at [https://discord.monorail.xyz](https://discord.monorail.xyz). We're always open for feedback if you run into anything that you'd like to see added or improved.
